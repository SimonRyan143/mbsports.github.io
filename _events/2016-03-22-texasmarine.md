MB Sports is proud to announce the addition of Texas Marine to the MB Dealer Network.  With 3 locations around the Houston area they will be servicing Southern Texas.

Visit Texasmarine.com to learn more about this great dealership.

Texas Marine opened for business in 1981 in Beaumont, Texas with two employees and a handful of boats. We made sure we had good people, the best boats available on the market, fair prices, and the very best service in the boating industry.

Those standards of business have served us well over the last twenty nine years, as evidenced by our tremendous growth and success. We now have three dealerships, with two in the Houston area, a store in Conroe and one in Clear Lake. Another sign of success is our customers, who continue to rely on Texas Marine for the best boats, best prices and best service in the industry. In fact, we have now served many families into the third generation of boat owners.

As one of the largest boat dealerships in Southeast Texas, we only carry the highest quality brands with the best names and reputations for customer satisfaction in the industry. We are still locally owned and operated, and with our key employee program, long-term employees enjoy ownership in the company. Join the growing family of Texas Marine customers and see why we've been the boaters' choice for twenty five years.
